# Forecasting Air Cargo Demand for Southeast Asia

Project report was collaborated on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online LaTeX editor for real-time collaboration. 
LaTeX source files are stored and updated in this repository to keep track of revisions. 

This project fulfills the requirements of a UROP under SUTD, in collaboration with the [Aviation Studies Institute](https://asi.sutd.edu.sg/) and the [International Air Transport Association](https://www.iata.org/) [IATA].

Open-source macroeconomic data was used in this project, and air cargo data was obtained via IATA's CargoIS platform. More details can be found in the final report.

> R and SQL scripts for data wrangling can be found under *IATA_Database*. Graphs were created in R via ggplot, while the data was queried via SQL and cleaned with Pandas in Python.

> Scripts for data wrangling in Python can be found under *Python_Fun*.

Final Report in pdf can be found under **.
